// rate limit, no DB call, no dependency on any other middleware initializing correctly. Exists
// specifically so Render's Health Check Path field and an external uptime monitor can be pointed
// at a single, minimal, always-fast path. /api/health above is unrelated and unchanged — the
// frontend's keep-alive ping and any existing Render config keep using that one.
